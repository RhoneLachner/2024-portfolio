# Sarah Rhone Lachner - Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my developer portfolio! This portfolio site was built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** to showcase my work as a developer and highlight my passion for clean, responsive design. Utilizing static site generation and optimized WebP images, the site ensures fast performance and a smooth user experience.

I used a **component-based architecture**, custom hooks, and state management to create an engaging user experience, while Tailwind CSS helped streamline the design process with scalable, efficient styling. **Playwright** was implemented to perform end-to-end testing, ensuring the contact form and email functionality work seamlessly.

Feel free to reach out through **LinkedIn**, **GitHub**, my band’s website, or send me a message directly via the **contact form** on this Portfolio site. I’d love to connect!
