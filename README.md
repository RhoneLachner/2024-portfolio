# Sarah Rhone Lachner - Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my developer portfolio! This site was built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** to showcase my development work and passion for clean, responsive design. It leverages **static site generation** and **optimized WebP images** to ensure fast load times and a smooth user experience.

The architecture is **component-based**, with custom hooks and state management to keep the interface efficient and interactive. Tailwind CSS provided a streamlined approach to styling, making it easy to maintain consistency and scalability across the design. I also implemented **Playwright** for end-to-end testing to ensure the contact form and email functionality work reliably.

Feel free to reach out through **LinkedIn**, **GitHub**, my band’s website, or send me a message directly via the **contact form** on this Portfolio site. I’d love to connect!
