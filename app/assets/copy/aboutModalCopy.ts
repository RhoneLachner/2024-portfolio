    `Hello! My name is Sarah Rhone-Ann Lachner, and I usually go by "Rhone."`,
    `I am a Software Engineer and Product Manager who is passionate about creating meaningful, human-centered technology that reflects both the natural world and our shared experience as people. I believe that technology is a reflection of ourselves, nature, and the universe, and I aim to create solutions that are not just functional, but also thoughtful and sustainable.`,
    `With a love for puzzles, pattern recognition, and problem-solving, I've found myself diving into many different fields throughout my life—from biology and human health to music production and sound engineering. I see patterns and structure in everything around me, and this perspective has fueled my passion for both art and technology. When I’m not at a keyboard, I enjoy crafting, cooking, wildcrafting medicinal herbs, playing music, and connecting with friends.`,
    `As a Software Engineer, I thrive on clean code, web accessibility, and turning complex challenges into structured solutions. My Product Management experience has strengthened my ability to lead and collaborate, giving me a well-rounded understanding of process and communication across teams. I love working on projects that push me to think outside the box, and I find joy in bringing clarity to complex systems.`,
    `Whether through engineering or product management, my goal is to build technology that makes the world a better place for both the people living in it today and future generations. I’m always excited to collaborate with companies that value people, creativity, and sustainability.`,
    `Feel free to reach out through LinkedIn, GitHub, or my band’s website, or send me a message directly. I’d love to connect!`,
