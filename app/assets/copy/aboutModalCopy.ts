    `Hello! My name is Sarah-Rhone Lachner, and I usually go by "Rhone."`,
    `I'm a web developer who is passionate about creating meaningful, human-centered technology that reflects the natural world and our shared experience as people. I believe that technology is a reflection of ourselves, nature, and the universe, and I aim to create thoughtful solutions that are functional, practical, efficient, and sustainable.`,
    `With a love for puzzles, pattern recognition, and problem-solving, I've found myself diving into many different fields throughout my life—from biology and human health to music production and sound engineering. I see patterns and structure in everything around me, and this perspective has fueled my passion for both art and technology. When I’m not at a keyboard, I enjoy crafting, cooking, wildcrafting medicinal herbs, playing music, learning new skills, building things with my hands, spending time in nature, and connecting with friends.`,
    `As a software engineer I thrive on clean code, web accessibility, and turning complex challenges into structured solutions. My Product Management experience has strengthened my ability to lead and collaborate, giving me a well-rounded understanding of process and communication across teams. I love working on projects that push me to think outside the box, and I find joy in continuously improving and learning new things.`,
    `Whether through engineering, product management, or art, my goal is to build things that make the world a better place for current and future generations. I’m always excited to collaborate with companies that value diversity, creativity, and kindness.`,
    `Please feel free to reach out through LinkedIn, GitHub, my band’s website, or send me a message directly. I’d love to connect!`,
